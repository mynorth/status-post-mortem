### Partial Outage: Portal

The v2.6.3 release included a schema migration which incorrectly renamed a
column in a single step.

**Started:** Wednesday, January 9th, 2019 10:08 AM GMT-0500

**Resolved:** Wednesday, January 9th, 2019 10:18 AM GMT-0500

**Duration:** 10 minutes

#### Details

v2.6.3 introduces an option to defer organization payouts until a specified
number of days after an event has ended. To implement this feature, an unused
(though referenced) database column was renamed to better reflect its new
purpose with moving forward.

The schema migration which renamed this column incorrectly renamed the column
outright, in a single step. As a result, the point during the deployment of
v2.6.3 after the schema migrations finished running but before new code had
been deployed yielded a production environment which was expecting the
pre-migration name of the columnâ€”which was no longer present.

The offending schema migration was rolled back after a period of
approximately 10 minutes, restoring expected access to portal event and
organization pages.

Finally, the schema migration was rewritten as a two-step migration. v2.6.3
was successfully deployed with both the old and new column present. A later
release will remove the old column.

#### Lessons

Destructive schema migrations should always be implemented as a two-step
process. In this case, the to-be-renamed column should have first been
duplicated. After v2.6.3 was deemed stable, the to-be-renamed column would be
later safely removed without issue.

Using a two-step approach to implementing destructive schema migrations
ensures both the pre-migration and post-migration code are able to run
side-by-side using the same schema.

#### Remediation/Prevention

* The pre-deployment schema migration review should be made more thorough
* All destructive schema migrations should be implemented in multiple steps
